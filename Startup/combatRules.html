        <p dir="ltr">
            Actions (marked by &gt;) can only be used on your turn in combat, and each
            named action can only be used once per turn unless stated otherwise. The
            same applies to actions from talents and other effects, regardless of
            whether those are given a specific name. Some actions take more time than
            others. Each action in this book lists how many you must spend to activate
            it: either &gt;, &gt;&gt;, or &gt;&gt;&gt;. (See “Order of Combat” for rules
            on how many actions you can use on your turn.) On your turn, you can spend
            your available to use any of the actions listed below, or to use any actions
            granted by your talents or other effects (such as the Breathe Stormlight
            action available to Radiants).

            You hide behind cover within 5 feet of you (see “Terrain”) to defend
            yourself against incoming attacks. All attacks against you gain a
            disadvantage for as long as you stay behind cover. If you attack or move,
            the benefits of this action end. You’re only protected against attacks from
            the other side of your cover, and it must be substantial enough to
            realistically defend you against the attack. For example, you could press
            yourself against a wall or duck behind an obstacle, but if an enemy rounds
            the corner toward you, they can attack you without disadvantage. If you have
            a weapon with the Defensive trait (such as a shield), you can wield it to
            create mobile cover for yourself. When you do, you must keep that weapon
            raised and between yourself and any potential attackers.

            You use one of your skills to seek the upper hand over your opponent, such

            how you are doing so, then make a test using a relevant skill against the
            enemy’s corresponding defense. On a success, you gain an advantage on your
            next test against that enemy that uses a different skill. For example, you
            can test Deduction test to guess at your foe’s next move, then use that
            advantage on your next Light Weaponry test; however, you can’t test Light
            Weaponry then use that advantage on another Light Weaponry test. (See

            Reactions

        <p dir="ltr">
            Reactions (marked by &lt;) are used to respond to specific event, known as a
            trigger, that happens on the battlefield. Each reaction describes its
            specific trigger. Though reactions can be triggered on your turn, they’re
            typically triggered on another character’s turn in response to something
            they do. You usually only have one reaction per round. If an effect grants
            you more than one reaction at a time, you can’t simultaneously use both of
            your reactions on the same trigger, but you can use the same type of
            reaction on two separate triggering events (for example, you can use Aid on
            two separate tests an ally makes on their turn). You can spend your
            available to use any of the reactions listed below, or to use any reactions
            granted by your talents or other effects.

                    Aid (&lt;) You step in to help an ally. Before an ally makes a skill
                    test, you can use this reaction and spend 1 focus to grant them an
                    advantage on their test. To aid an ally, you must be prepared and in
                    range to realistically assist them. For example, you might aid their
                    attack by flanking and distracting an enemy you’re engaged with, or
                    if you’re within speaking distance, you might coordinate with them

                    Avoid Danger (&lt;) When you’re imperiled by your surroundings—such
                    as standing under a falling boulder or being shoved off a
                    balcony—you can use this reaction to attempt to save yourself. This
                    might allow you to catch yourself before you fall, to dodge out of
                    the way of a boulder, or to similarly avoid the danger. Make an
                    Agility test to avoid the danger. If doing so in reaction to a test
                    (such as an attack or Shove action) the DC is equal to that test’s
                    result. Otherwise, the DC is 15. If you fail, you don’t avoid the
                    danger. If you succeed, you avoid the danger to a reasonable degree,
                    as determined by the GM. For example, if you’re trying to avoid an
                    area attack from the Division surge, the GM might say you move 5
                    feet on a success—if this movement gets you out of the area, you
                    aren’t hit, but if the area is larger, you’ll likely still be
                    affected to some degree. The more narrative focused the danger, the
                    more likely you can entirely avoid it, but any potential damage or
                    repercussions are at the GM’s discretion.

                    attack test. You can’t use this reaction on area attacks or on those
                    that target multiple characters, though you might be able to Avoid

            Conditions
        </h1>
        <p dir="ltr">
            Many effects can apply a temporary condition to you (for example, “you
            become Slowed”). These alter your abilities for the duration of that effect,
            as described in the upcoming “Durations” section. If an effect doesn’t state
            its duration (or how you can remove the condition early), all the rules you
            need for determining that are in the condition itself. Conditions generally
            only apply to characters, not objects. For example, if a rule tells you to
            apply a condition to targets in a certain area, objects in that area ignore
            that condition. However, when it fits the story, the GM might decide that
            objects are affected by a condition (or by a similar narrative effect). This
            game includes the following conditions, listed in alphabetical order.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <h3 dir="ltr">
            Afflicted
        </h3>
        <p dir="ltr">
            While Afflicted, you slowly take damage over time. In combat, at the end of
            each of your turns, you take the amount and type of damage specified by the
            effect that gave you the condition; this information is typically stated in
            brackets. For example, if you’re Afflicted [1d4 vital], you take 1d4 damage
            at the end of each of your turns. Out of combat, you instead take that
            damage every 10 seconds and after each time someone attempts to remove the
            condition. Unlike most conditions, you can be Afflicted by multiple effects
            simultaneously. When this happens, resolve each effect separately.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <h3 dir="ltr">
            Determined
        </h3>
        <p dir="ltr">
            While Determined, when you fail a test, you can add an Opportunity to the
            result. After you choose to do so, remove the Determined condition.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <h3 dir="ltr">
            Disoriented
        </h3>
        <p dir="ltr">
            While Disoriented, your senses are disrupted, making most tasks difficult.
            You can’t use reactions, your senses always count as obscured, and
            Perception tests (and similar tests to use your senses) gain a disadvantage.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <h3 dir="ltr">
            Empowered
        </h3>
        <p dir="ltr">
            When a Knight Radiant swears an Ideal, they become Empowered, granting a
            burst of unrestrained power. While Empowered, you gain an advantage on all
            tests and your Investiture refills to your maximum at the start of each of
            your turns. Remove this condition at the end of the current scene.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <h3 dir="ltr">
            Enhanced
        </h3>
        <p dir="ltr">
            While Enhanced, one of your attributes temporarily increases, as specified
            in brackets when you gain that condition. The specified attribute gains a
            bonus equal to the specified number; however, this bonus doesn’t change your
            defenses, maximum health, maximum focus, or maximum Investiture. For
            example, if you have a Speed of 3 and become Enhanced [+2 Speed], you
            temporarily gain the following benefits:
        </p>
        <p dir="ltr">
            ◆ Gain a +2 bonus to Agility, Light Weaponry, Stealth, and Thievery tests.
        </p>
        <p dir="ltr">
            ◆ Gain a +2 bonus to any talents that directly use your Speed.
        </p>
        <p dir="ltr">
            ◆ Increase your movement rate from 30 feet to 40 feet.
        </p>
        <p dir="ltr">
            Unlike most conditions, Enhanced has a cumulative effect, and more than one
            of your attributes can be Enhanced at a time.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <h3 dir="ltr">
            Exhausted
        </h3>
        <p dir="ltr">
            While exhausted, you feel fatigued and your skill tests become more
            difficult. When you gain this condition, it states a negative number in
            brackets. After you calculate a test result but before you resolve its
            effects, apply a penalty equal to this number. After each long rest, reduce
            your Exhausted penalty by 1. The condition is removed when your penalty
            equals 0. Unlike most conditions, Exhausted has a cumulative effect. When
            you gain a second instance of this condition, add its listed penalty to your
            current Exhausted penalty. For example, if an effect makes you Exhausted
            [−2], you subtract 2 from the result of all tests; if a different effect
            then makes you Exhausted [−1], that increases your Exhausted penalty, so you
            now subtract 3 from the result of all tests. As usual, your final test
            result can’t be less than 0, regardless of your penalty.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <h3 dir="ltr">
            Focused
        </h3>
        <p dir="ltr">
            While Focused, you are engaged and intent on your task. When you use an
            ability that costs focus, its cost is reduced by 1.
